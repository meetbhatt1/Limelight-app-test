# LimelightIT App - Workflow Summary

## Complete Workflow for Presentation

### **1. Alert Acknowledgment & Operator Assignment Flow**

**Supervisor Side:**

1. System generates alert (e.g., "Machine M-101 idle > 30 min")
2. Supervisor sees alert in **AlertsScreen**
3. Supervisor taps **"Acknowledge & Assign"**
4. **Operator Assignment Modal** appears with:
   - List of available operators
   - Optional notes field
5. Supervisor selects operator and assigns
6. Alert status changes to "Acknowledged"
7. Alert disappears from AlertsScreen (hidden until resolved)
8. Maintenance assignment is created in Redux

**Operator Side:**

- Operator can see assigned maintenance tasks
- Operator investigates the machine
- **Two scenarios:**

#### **Scenario A: It's Downtime**

- Operator records downtime via **DowntimeForm**
- Selects reason (e.g., "No Order → Planned")
- Downtime appears in **ReportsScreen** for supervisor review
- Supervisor sees operator's response in Reports
- Supervisor clears alert once resolved

#### **Scenario B: It's System Error**

- Operator reports back to supervisor (via Maintenance screen)
- Supervisor assigns maintenance to operator or another technician
- Maintenance task created
- Alert remains hidden until maintenance completed

### **2. Machine Detail Screen (Now Fully Functional)**

**Features:**

- **Real-time stats** from actual downtime data
- **Active Quick Actions:**
- **Add Photo**: Opens camera/gallery
- **Maintenance**: Shows assigned maintenance or navigates to Maintenance tab
- **Reports**: Navigates to Reports (supervisor only)
- **Recent Activity**: Shows actual downtime entries
- **Downtime Control**: Functional start/end downtime buttons

### **3. Alert Filtering Logic**

- Alerts for machines with **active maintenance assignments** are **automatically hidden**
- Once maintenance is completed, alerts can reappear if issue persists
- This prevents alert spam and focuses supervisor attention

### **4. Data Flow**

```
System Alert → Supervisor Acknowledges → Assigns Operator
    ↓
Operator Investigates
    ↓
    ├─→ Records Downtime → Appears in Reports
    └─→ Reports System Error → Maintenance Assigned → Alert Hidden
```

### **5. Key Improvements Made**

1.  **MachineDetailScreen**: All buttons now functional with real data
2.  **Operator Assignment Modal**: Beautiful modal for selecting operators
3.  **Maintenance Assignment System**: Tracks who's assigned to which machine
4.  **Smart Alert Filtering**: Hides alerts for machines under maintenance
5.  **Real Data Integration**: Stats and activity from actual downtime records

### **6. Presentation Tips**

**Demo Flow:**

1. Login as **Supervisor**
2. Show **AlertsScreen** with system alerts
3. Tap "Acknowledge & Assign" → Show operator selection
4. Assign to operator → Alert disappears
5. Switch to **Operator** role (or show in separate device)
6. Show **MachineDetailScreen** with functional buttons
7. Record downtime → Show in **ReportsScreen**
8. Switch back to Supervisor → Show Reports with operator's downtime entries
9. Clear alert

**Key Points to Highlight:**

- Offline-first: Works without internet
- Real-time sync when online
- Smart alert management
- Operator-supervisor collaboration
- Complete audit trail

### **7. Redux State Structure**

```javascript
{
  app: { user, role, token, isAuthenticated },
  data: {
    downtimes: [],
    maintenances: [],
    alerts: [],
    operators: [],
    maintenanceAssignments: []
  },
  queue: {
    downtimeQueue: [],
    maintenanceQueue: []
  }
}
```
